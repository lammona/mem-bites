# 📘 Mem Bites

*A minimal memory-training app that helps users learn and retain bite-sized facts over time.*

🔗 **Live Demo:** [mem-bites.vercel.app](https://mem-bites.vercel.app)

---

## 🧠 Overview

I built **Mem Bites** to create a lightweight, low-effort way to improve how we learn and remember information. Whether it's animals, science, or historical facts, the app uses AI to generate short, memorable facts on any topic the user wants to learn about.

Once a topic is entered (e.g., *"falcon"*), the app fetches three concise facts using OpenAI. Users can accept, reject, or edit the facts. These **"mems"** are then delivered back to the user through spaced notifications, helping reinforce memory over time with minimal user effort.

**The goal:** Make learning effortless, intentional, and more effective—one bite at a time.
